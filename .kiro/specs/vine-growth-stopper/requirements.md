# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a NeoForge Minecraft mod for version 1.21.1 that prevents vines and cave vines from naturally growing and spreading. The mod should stop the natural growth mechanics of these blocks while maintaining their existing placement and functionality when manually placed by players.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Minecraft player, I want to prevent vines from naturally growing and spreading, so that I can maintain clean builds without unwanted vine overgrowth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vine growth is disabled in config THEN the mod SHALL prevent vine blocks from attempting to grow naturally
2. WHEN vine growth is disabled in config THEN the mod SHALL prevent vine blocks from attempting to spread to adjacent blocks
3. WHEN a player manually places a vine block THEN the mod SHALL allow the placement without interference
4. WHEN existing vine blocks are present in the world THEN the mod SHALL not remove them but prevent further growth

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Minecraft player, I want to prevent cave vines from naturally growing, so that I can control the appearance of lush caves without constant vine management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cave vine growth is disabled in config THEN the mod SHALL prevent cave vine blocks from attempting to grow downward
2. WHEN cave vine growth is disabled in config THEN the mod SHALL prevent cave vines from attempting to extend their length naturally
3. WHEN a player manually places cave vine blocks THEN the mod SHALL allow the placement without interference
4. WHEN existing cave vine blocks are present THEN the mod SHALL preserve them but stop natural growth

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want the mod to work consistently across all players, so that vine growth prevention is applied uniformly without affecting gameplay balance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mod is installed on a server THEN it SHALL apply vine growth prevention for all players
2. WHEN multiple players are in areas with vines THEN the mod SHALL consistently prevent growth regardless of player proximity
3. WHEN the mod is loaded THEN it SHALL not cause performance issues or lag
4. IF the mod is removed THEN vine growth SHALL return to vanilla behavior without world corruption

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want an easy-to-use configuration file with true/false values, so that I can selectively control which types of vines are prevented from growing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mod is first loaded THEN it SHALL create a configuration file with boolean options for each vine type
2. WHEN a vine type is set to false in the config THEN the mod SHALL completely prevent growth attempts for that vine type
3. WHEN a vine type is set to true in the config THEN the mod SHALL allow normal vanilla growth behavior for that vine type
4. WHEN the configuration file is modified THEN the mod SHALL apply changes without requiring a restart
5. WHEN vine growth is disabled for a type THEN the game SHALL not even attempt to process growth events for those blocks

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a modpack creator, I want the mod to be compatible with other mods, so that it can be included in modpacks without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN other mods modify vine behavior THEN this mod SHALL work alongside them without conflicts
2. WHEN the mod is used with world generation mods THEN it SHALL not interfere with initial vine placement
3. WHEN the mod is combined with other growth-related mods THEN it SHALL maintain its specific vine growth prevention
4. IF other mods add custom vine types THEN the mod SHOULD be extensible to handle them
